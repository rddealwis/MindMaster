Mind Master is a very simple game where you have to memorize the sequence of colored tiles. 

The aim of the game is to find the correct order which the tiles got colored.

The game difficulty increases with the level.

There are several game modes:
- Classic: the game difficulty increases with the level, the games can be wrong three times
- Speed: you have less than 1 second to memorize the tiles locations
- Crazy: it will drive you crazy!
- Impossible Mission: probably one of the most difficult modes
- Endurance: quite easy but be patient
- Kamikaze: very hard, no mistake is allowed (0 lives)

Be the best on each mode & test how good your short term memory is.
